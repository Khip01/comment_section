# gh-pages

### WHERE did these files come from?
These files come from the build results of the flutter web application project into several files that can be executed by the website.

## Steps 
Here is how to generate the following files
- Go to the flutter_web_app project directory ```cd flutter_web_app```
- Run the ```flutter build web``` command _(more details in the [Flutter Docs - Web Build](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#build))_
- This will create a new folder ```build/web/``` and it's content
- Then finally all the contents of the ```build/web``` folder will be placed in this ```gh-pages``` branch
